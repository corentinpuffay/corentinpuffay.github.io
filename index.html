    <p>About me</p>
    <p>
      I am a researcher fascinated by neuroscience and deep learning. 
      At EPFL, I developed a strong engineering foundation through coursework in programming, 
      machine learning, and neuroscience. 
      My Ph.D. at KU Leuven focuses on relating continuous speech to brain signals (EEG) using novel 
      deep learning architectures ranging from convolutional networks to transformers. 
      I also leverage the use of recent large language models to extract meaningful language 
      representations to predict brain responses from invasive (electrocorticography) and noninvasive 
      recording modalities. 
      The goal is to model speech processing in the brain and develop novel EEG-based diagnostic tools 
      and hearing prostheses, as well as to understand the mechanisms underlying language processing 
      in the brain.
